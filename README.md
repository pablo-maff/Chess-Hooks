# Chess Game

Implemented from scratch with JS and React Hooks

## Features

### Everything you need in a chess game: 

  - Check
  - Promotion
  - Castling
  - En Passant

## TODO

  - Move promotion to pawn movements and castling to king movements to simplify the logic here
  - Implement notifications
  - Implement visualization of moves history and map the square id's to real chess square names
  - Fix moves history to work properly with en passant
  - Work on the CSS
  - Implement more tests
  - Change lodash chunk to flexbox on Board component
  - Create a getPath function in movement helpers to not repeat code in every piece movement rules and to use it for checkmate notification
  - Change for loops to use functions when possible
  - Define @params for all functions
  - Write more comments
